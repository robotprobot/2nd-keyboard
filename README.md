# Simplified 2nd-keyboard
A simplified version of TaranVH's 2nd-keyboard project (LUAMACROS) for general use

#### THIS PROJECT IS A FORK OF THE 2ND-KEYBOARD PROJECT BY TARAN VAN HEMERT (FROM LINUSTECHTIPS), FOUND AT https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/
More specifically, this is a fork of his LUAMACROS version, found in the LUAMACROS folder at his repo.
I decided to clean the code up, make it more readable, remove unnecessary components and make it more 'noob friendly'.
I have also designed it for more general use and removed all the Adobe Premiere content that Taran uses it for.
He has a lot of much more advanced scripts available on his github for macros.
This script is just a basic executor, using an entire second keyboard as a macro board, intercepted by LuaMacros.
